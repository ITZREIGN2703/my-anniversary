        The date <strong>27 March 2023</strong> was the day I confessed my love
        to you through texts. To start off, I would like to say this again and
        again until we grow old and leave this Planet, I Love You So So Much and
        I hope we can be together for many more years to come.üíï
        <br />
        You have to read a lot today so get ready my love.ü§£ It has been a year
        that we have been together, and I feel really lucky having you by my
        side.
        <br />
        Being with you, I think it is really lucky for me. Do you remember when
        we are not together yet and we stay until 8 o&apos;clock everyday to
        just chat with each other? You are my lucky charm because being of that
        mum thought that I stayed at school to study because I don&apos;t have
        laptop and she bought it for me.üòÇIt was really funny how you brought
        that luck to me sweetheart. After that, we would also continue to chats.
        I don&apos;t really know when I fell in love with you but I know for you
        that right now you fill my heart. We made a lot of memories such as
        drinking beer together, do you remember that? We also went to the gym
        together, that was fun. We ate too many thing and I ate too much
        that&apos;s why I am this fatü§£but it is okay, those time with you were
        majestic and I really glad I got to spend them with you. We cannot just
        eat a lot without a care again since I want to lose weight but we will
        do other things together. Maybe next year or a few more years, we can go
        far from the city and go to the sea, forest, mountain, etc. You are my
        heart&apos;s desireüòò so we will spend those time together too and I
        know it will be really fun. After I confessed to you, I really want to
        be always with you and it felt like an eternity when I am not with you.
        I still feel the same now but we are adult now we have responsibilities,
        we cannot act the same like we used to before. I believe that even
        though right now we do our own things, we will meet up once again and
        have fun together. We just have to bear with it until then. You are the
        reason for muy happiness. You know I just want you to be always happy
        since if you are happy, you make my world brighter too. I know there
        will be many more problems in store for us in the future but I am sure
        that we will go through them together. We will not lose to anything that
        life throws at us because we are one.üíùSomething a little more serious
        though, after all the things we went though, we have to look into the
        future and try to earn money by ourselves. I want to try many different
        things, travelling abroad with you, would be the perfect holiday. When
        money is not a problem to us anymore, then it would be perfect. I would
        like to try ice skiing, it would be a really fun activity for us to do
        together.ü§©You know, writing this I really didn&apos;t plan at all, I
        just write whatever come into my mind. Another thing I want to say is
        that, you have already received the present by the time you read this so
        in the small notebook I want us to write anything in there, our feeling
        that day, something we want to say, we can just write it in that book,
        that book would be 1 year worth of memories for us too since we could
        not remember everything. Our anniversary next year, let&apos;s celebrate
        outside since at that time we already have work to do so we have money
        to spend and also we will exchange the book on our second year
        anniversary.üíï‚ù§Ô∏è
