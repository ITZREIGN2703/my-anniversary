        The date <strong>27 March 2023</strong> was the day I confessed my love
        to you through texts. To start off, I would like to say this again and
        again until we grow old and leave this Planet, I Love You So So Much and
        I hope we can be together for many more years to come.💕
        <br />
        You have to read a lot today so get ready my love.🤣 It has been a year
        that we have been together, and I feel really lucky having you by my
        side.
